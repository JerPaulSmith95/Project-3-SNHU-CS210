# Project-3-SNHU-CS210
This is the code that I created for the third Project in my CS210: Programming Languages course at SNHU. It takes a file input of an itemized list, reads through each line, and adds/updates a count of each word using a map function, and displays user requested information based off of a menu display, all in C++.
